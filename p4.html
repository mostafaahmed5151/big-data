Advantages of Big Data
Better decision-making: In the NewVantage Partners survey, 36.2 percent of respondents said that better decision-making was the number one goal of their big data analytics efforts. In addition, 84.1 percent had started working toward that goal, and 59.0 percent had experienced some measurable success, for an overall success rate of 69.0 percent. Analytics can give business decision-makers the data-driven insights they need to help their companies compete and grow.
Increased productivity: A separate survey from vendor Syncsort found that 59.9 percent of respondents were using big data tools like Hadoop and Spark to increase business user productivity. Modern big data tools are allowing analysts to analyze more data, more quickly, which increases their personal productivity. In addition, the insights gained from those analytics often allow organizations to increase productivity more broadly throughout the company.
Reduce costs: Both the Syncsort and the NewVantage surveys found that big data analytics were helping companies decrease their expenses. Nearly six out of ten (59.4 percent) respondents told Syncsort big data tools had helped them increase operational efficiency and reduce costs, and about two thirds (66.7 percent) of respondents to the NewVantage survey said they had started using big data to decrease expenses. Interestingly, however, only 13.0 percent of respondents selected cost reduction as their primary goal for big data analytics, suggesting that for many this is merely a very welcome side benefit.
Improved customer service: Among respondents to the NewVantage survey, improving customer service was the second most common primary goal for big data analytics projects, and 53.4 percent of companies had experienced some success in this regard. Social media, customer relationship management (CRM) systems and other points of customer contact give today's enterprises a wealth of information about their customers, and it is only natural that they would use this data to better serve those customers.

Disadvantages of Big Data
Need for talent: Data scientists and big data experts are among the most highly coveted —and highly paid — workers in the IT field. The AtScale survey found that the lack of a big data skill set has been the number one big data challenge for the past three years. And in the Syncsort survey, respondents ranked skills and staff as the second biggest challenge when creating a data lake. Hiring or training staff can increase costs considerably, and the process of acquiring big data skills can take considerable time.
Data quality:In the Syncsort survey, the number one disadvantage to working with big data was the need to address data quality issues. Before they can use big data for analytics efforts, data scientists and analysts need to ensure that the information they are using is accurate, relevant and in the proper format for analysis. That slows the reporting process considerably, but if enterprises don't address data quality issues, they may find that the insights generated by their analytics are worthless — or even harmful if acted upon.
Need for cultural change: Many of the organizations that are utilizing big data analytics don't just want to get a little bit better at reporting, they want to use analytics to create a data-driven culture throughout the company. In fact, in the NewVantage survey, a full 98.6 percent of executives said that their firms were in the process of creating this new type of corporate culture. However, changing culture is a tall order. So far, only 32.4 percent were reporting success on this front.
Compliance: Another thorny issue for big analytics efforts is complying with government regulations. Much of the information included in companies' big data stores is sensitive or personal, and that means the firm may need to ensure that they are meeting industry standards or government requirements when handling and storing the data. In the Syncsort survey, data governance, including compliance, was the third most significant barrier to working with big data. In fact, when respondents were asked to rank big data challenges on a scale from 1 (most significant) to 5 (least significant), this disadvantage of big data got more 1s than another other challenge.
Cybersecurity risks: Storing big data, particularly sensitive data, can make companies a more attractive target for cyberattackers. In the AtScale survey, respondents have consistently listed security as one of the top challenges of big data, and in the NewVantage report, executives ranked cybersecurity breaches as the single greatest data threat their companies face.
Rapid change: Another potential drawback to big data analytics is that the technology is changing rapidly. Organizations face the very real possibility that they will invest in a particular technology only to have something much better come along a few months later. Syncsort respondents ranked this disadvantage of big data fourth among all the potential challenges they faced.
